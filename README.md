- i3 (i3-gaps)
- i3blocks
- bumblebee-status
- rofi
- compton (transparency)

This is my custom i3-gaps config file that I configured over the past few months.

Feel free to copy of fork any of these files and edit them to your liking.

This config is for a dual monitor setup.

The config file for i3-gaps is a little messy but i'm working on cleaning it up.

There is a i3blocks config although i've recently switched to bumblebee-status which is much easier to use as it doesn't use a config file.

Rofi is configured in a nice dark theme.

The compton.conf file is very simple.
